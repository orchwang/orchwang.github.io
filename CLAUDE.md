This document provides comprehensive guidance for AI assistants working on this personal wiki project.

---

## Project Overview

### Purpose

This is a **Jekyll-based personal wiki** designed for systematic development learning management. It helps developers track their learning journey using a "도장깨기" (achievement stamps) approach - marking off completed learning items like collecting stamps.

### Target Audience

Developers who want to:

- Track their learning progress systematically
- Build a knowledge base of technical topics
- Maintain a portfolio of completed learning items
- Create interconnected learning resources

### Core Philosophy

- **Progressive Learning**: Break down large topics into manageable items
- **Visual Progress**: Use checkboxes to show completion status
- **Interconnected Knowledge**: Link related posts together
- **Documentation as Learning**: Writing about topics reinforces understanding

---

## Writing New Posts

### Post Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md
```

**Examples:**

- `2025-10-15-python-decorators.md`
- `2025-10-16-react-hooks-guide.md`
- `2025-10-17-binary-search-tree.md`

### Front Matter Template

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [Roadmap|Programming|Computer-Science]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
published: true
---
```

**Important Notes:**

- `layout`: Always use `post` for content posts
- `title`: Post title (use quotes if it contains special characters)
- `date`: Must be in YYYY-MM-DD format and match the filename date
  - **Always use today's actual date** (not future dates)
  - Jekyll hides future-dated posts by default
  - Example: If today is 2024-10-12, use `date: 2024-10-12`
- `categories`: Use singular form, choose one primary category
- `tags`: Use array format with square brackets
- `published`: Controls post visibility
  - `true` = Post appears on the site (default for all published content)
  - `false` = Draft post, hidden from builds
  - **Always include this field** when creating or updating posts
- Multi-word categories: Use hyphens (e.g., `Computer-Science` not `Computer Space`)

### Content Structure Template

## AI Assistant Workflow

### When Adding New Learning Posts

1. **Create the post** with proper naming and front matter
   - Include all required fields: `layout`, `title`, `date`, `categories`, `tags`, `published`
   - Set `published: true` for posts ready to be displayed
2. **Update related roadmap** if applicable:
   ```markdown
   - [x] New Topic - [[Link to new post](/YYYY/MM/DD/new-post.html)]
   ```
3. **Update progress statistics** in roadmap
4. **Add cross-references** in related posts
5. **Verify categories and tags** are consistent

### When Updating Roadmaps

1. **Find completed items** that have associated posts
2. **Change checkbox**: `[ ]` → `[x]`
3. **Add link**: `[[Title](/YYYY/MM/DD/post.html)]`
4. **Recalculate progress**:
   ```markdown
   현재 완료한 항목: **X개**
   전체 항목: **Y개**
   진행률: **Z%**
   ```

### Maintaining Consistency

**Categories:**

- Use existing categories when possible
- New categories should be broad themes
- Avoid too many categories (keep it manageable)

**Tags:**

- Use existing tags for consistency
- Create new tags only when needed
- Use CamelCase for multi-word tags (e.g., `DataStructure`)
- Keep tags specific and meaningful

**Formatting:**

- Use Korean for main content (target audience is Korean)
- Use English for code, technical terms, and proper nouns
- Keep code examples well-commented
- Use consistent heading hierarchy

---

## Key Features to Maintain

### 1. Quick Links (바로가기)

**Location:** Home page (index.html)
**Cards:**

- 📚 태그 (Tags)
- 🗂️ 카테고리 (Categories)
- 👤 CV

**Purpose:** Fast navigation to main sections

### 2. Search Functionality

**Location:** Header on all pages
**Features:**

- Real-time client-side search
- Searches title, content, and tags
- Results with highlights
- No server required (static site)

### 3. Logo and Branding

**Logo:** `assets/images/logo/orchwang.png`
**Locations:**

- Header (all pages): 50px height
- CV page: 100px width, centered
- Favicon: Multiple sizes for browsers

**Maintain:** Consistent branding across all pages

### 4. Navigation Menu

**Order:** 홈 | 카테고리 | 태그 | CV
**Keep:** Same order in header and quick links

### 5. Responsive Design

- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Logo scales down on mobile
- Navigation adapts for small screens
- Touch-friendly buttons and links

---

## Best Practices

### For Roadmap Management

1. **Start broad, get specific**: Main topics → subtopics → detailed items
2. **Link everything**: Every checked item should link to a learning post
3. **Update regularly**: Review and check off items as you learn
4. **Track progress**: Keep statistics current for motivation
5. **One roadmap per domain**: Don't mix unrelated topics

### For Technical Posts

1. **Start with why**: Explain importance before diving into details
2. **Show, don't just tell**: Include working code examples
3. **Multiple examples**: Show different use cases
4. **Explain complexity**: Include time/space complexity for algorithms
5. **Link to next steps**: Guide readers to related topics

### For Knowledge Management

1. **Write as you learn**: Don't wait until you're an expert
2. **Link related content**: Build a web of knowledge
3. **Update old posts**: Improve clarity based on new understanding
4. **Use consistent formatting**: Makes content easier to navigate
5. **Tag thoughtfully**: Makes content discoverable
